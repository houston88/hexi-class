====

**Hexi** is a fun and easy way to make HTML5 games or any other
kind interactive media using pure JavaScript code.

### Lesson 1

1. Open the index.html file in cloud9 web ide by opening index.html, and then clicking Preview -> Live Preview File.
1. If running the file locally with node (not in a web ide), run `npm start`.
1. Read through the code in `/js/lesson_1.js`, you will see the following sections.
1. The `load` function, that will run while your files are loading.
1. The `setup` function, which initializes your game objects, variables and sprites.
1. The `play` function, which is your game or application logic that runs in a loop.
1. Try to load a different image (l.33 and l.121), there are a ton in /images.
1. Try and create a .png file and load that, maybe a favorite anime or webcomic character?
1. Change the message on l.153 to make sense with your new image.

### Lesson 2

1. Open the index.html file and comment out lesson one, and uncomment lesson2_treasure_hunter.js. (command / is a shortcut to do this)
1. Click on the Run button in cloud9 ide while you have index.html open.
1. Try out the game!
1. Now lets read through the code. Open js/lesson_2_treasure_hunter.js.
1. Find the numberOfEnemies = 6 line. Try playing with these variables to make the game harder, like really hard!
1. Try making the hits do more damage! Now it's harder!
1. Pretty cool huh! By just changing a few variables, we can make the game harder.

### Lesson 3

1. Check out the new treasure hunter with images!
1. Lets add our own custom images.
1. More info here. [https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi#using-images](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi#using-images)
1. There is also good information in the link about creating "texture atlas" that has all the sprites in one file, pretty cool!
