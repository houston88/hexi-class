Creat games using Hexi
====

**Hexi** is a fun and easy way to make HTML5 games or any other
kind interactive media using pure JavaScript code.

### Lesson 1

1. Start Hexi (I'll help you get this setup in that online code editor) by running: `npm start`
1. Read through the code in `/js/lesson_1.js`, you will see the following sections.
1. The `load` function, that will run while your files are loading.
1. The `setup` function, which initializes your game objects, variables and sprites.
1. The `play` function, which is your game or application logic that runs in a loop.
1. Create a new .npg type image (someone's face maybe?) and replace it in this demo.
